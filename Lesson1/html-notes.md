In HTML, we use **elements** to create the "structure" of the web page.

Every **element** consists of **tags**. Example of HTML tag is <!DOCTYPE html> or <head>.
There are opening tags and closing tags. Opening tags consists of <>, the name of the element, and **attributes** (e.g. charset, name, content, lang). Closing HTML tag consists of <>, slash (/) and the name of the element only.
